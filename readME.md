# Description 
This repo is used to make an anomaly detection scheme for maritime pirate attacks. I use the public dataset (url shown below) and try to build an autoencoder networks to make a presiction model. Basically, anomaly detection is a process of finding patterns or instances in a dataset that deviate significantly from the expected or “normal behavior”. Meanwhile,  
## Dataset

$$g(x) = 2x$$
$$\frac{2}{x}$$
