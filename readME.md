# Description 
This repo is used to make an anomaly detection scheme for maritime pirate attacks. I use the public dataset (url shown below) and try to build an autoencoder networks to make a presiction model. Basically, anomaly detection is a process of finding patterns or instances in a dataset that deviate significantly from the expected or “normal behavior”. Meanwhile,  
## Dataset
public dataset : (https://github.com/newzealandpaul/Maritime-Pirate-Attacks/tree/main)
## The Mathematics
<p>Equation
$$f(x)= 2$$
</p>
Equation
$$g(x) = 2x$$
Equation
$$\frac{2}{x}$$
Equation
$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = x$$
$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = h$$

The result from this detection is shown below
